# BankAPI
this project implements cash deposite, cash withdrawal and show balance of an account. When these operations ran on multithreaded environment

Here in the ATM class there are 3 threads(ATM,ATM1,ATM2) which are run parallelly on a single account. Later checking the balance of the bankaccount which will be 0 consistently.

This is to depect on a parallel deposite / withdrawal operations this App works fine.
